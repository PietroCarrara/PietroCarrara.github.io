However, the Japanese are aware of their plans, and send their agents to infiltrate and sabotage the mission.
This film has spies doing what they do best: handling information. The first scene has the protagonists split into 2 groups, with no radios or other ways to contact each other. In a following scene, when one of the groups learns that they&amp;rsquo;re being watched, they must pass this information to their teammates without busting their identity.</description></item><item><title>Huion HS64 Drivers</title><link>https://pietrocarrara.github.io/post/2020-08-25-hs64-tablet-drivers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pietrocarrara.github.io/post/2020-08-25-hs64-tablet-drivers/</guid><description>Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, I found myself with too much free time; so much that I decided to try a new hobby: Drawing. I don&amp;rsquo;t plan to take it seriously, I just want to scribble something while I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything better to do.
So I decided to borrow a pen-tablet from a friend who has a Wacom. It was a pretty neat device. Simply plug it in and everything works out of the box.</description></item></channel></rss>
