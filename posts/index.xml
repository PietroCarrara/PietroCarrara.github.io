      <description> using Plots f(x) = 0.1sin(x) + -cos(3x) plot(f, 1:0.01:10)  The sine function.   Now I can just write plain Julia code and have it generate results for me:
x = [&amp;#34;Nerds&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Hackers&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Scientists&amp;#34;] y = [0.4, 0.35, 0.25] pie(x, y, title = &amp;#34;The Julia Community&amp;#34;, l = 0.5)     </description>

      <description>Drunken Master is one of the movies that helped set-up Jackie Chan&amp;rsquo;s career as a martial artist, along with  Snake in the Eagle&amp;rsquo;s Shadow and  The Young Master. It has almost all the elements that became synonymous with Chan&amp;rsquo;s later movies: Great fighting mixed with comedy and his high energy charisma. The only thing that&amp;rsquo;s missing is the crazy stunts, but the movie has enough kung-fu to make up for it.</description>

      <description>Cliff Walkers follows 4 Chinese spies trying to reach the Japanese-dominated city of Harbin, where they should await for further instructions. However, the fascists are aware of their plans, and send their agents to infiltrate and sabotage the mission.
This film has spies doing what they do best: handling information. The first scene has the protagonists split into 2 groups, with no radios or other ways to contact each other.</description>

      <description>Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, I found myself with too much free time; so much that I decided to try a new hobby: Drawing. I don&amp;rsquo;t plan to take it seriously, I just wanted to scribble something while I don&amp;rsquo;t have anything better to do.
So I decided to borrow a pen-tablet from a friend who has a Wacom. It was a pretty neat device. Simply plug it in and everything worked out of the box.</description>
