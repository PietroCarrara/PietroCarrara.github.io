    >The Young Master</a></em>. It has almost all the elements that became synonymous with Chan&rsquo;s later movies: Great fighting mixed with comedy and his high energy charisma. The only thing that&rsquo;s missing is the crazy stunts, but the movie has enough kung-fu to make up for it. In fact, this is one of the main differences when you compare this film with other of Chan&rsquo;s works: Here, <strong>everybody <em>fights</em></strong>. And they don&rsquo;t just throw some punches around; this is a martial arts movie, after all.</p>

<p>In a Jackie Chan movie, what usually happens in fight scenes is: Jackie starts unarmed against a pack of grunts, and slowly takes them out, maybe breaking some bones in the process. It&rsquo;s not like the grunts don&rsquo;t know how to fight, but all they do are simple moves. A punch here, a kick there; maybe do some jumps. <strong>The only one doing the complex stuff is Chan</strong>. And when there is a one-on-one fight, Jackie usually has a disadvantage: This makes for scenes where no matter the number of enemies or their strength, Chan has to climb from the bottom-up to win, leading to amazing stunts and moves in order to achieve the feat.</p>
<p>In this film, all the fights (with only one exception, I think) are one-on-one. They have a much more explicit rhythm and the actors do their moves in sync, connecting one strike to the next. It&rsquo;s more akin to watching a (very cool) ballet session, in a way that got me thinking about <em>
<a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/890-neon-genesis-evangelion/season/1/episode/9"
    
    
        target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    
    >that</a></em> Evangelion episode. Both fighters are working together to make the action flow, which is a different experience when compared to &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; Jackie Chan fighting scenes.</p>
<p>Since <strong>everybody is doing complex moves</strong> (instead of just Jackie doing them), the pace is more steady (but not calm), as opposed to the more erratic flow commonly seen in modern action movies: <em>Punch, wait. Kick, wait. Pull, wait.</em> Of course, this has its reason to be: the moves are hard to do, plus you don&rsquo;t want to hurt anyone involved. But it ends up pulling the fighting closer to the aforementioned <em>ballet session</em>, and away from the more desirable <em>crazy stunt scene</em>.</p>

<p>Since we&rsquo;re talking about dancing so much, how can we not speak of the music in this film? The main theme is awesome. It feels very powerful, starting with a low, long sequence that then spikes into a very (and I mean <em>very</em>) loud section that goes speeding up until it ends. It&rsquo;s based on a Chinese folk song, the same one that inspired the main theme of <em>
<a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/10617-wong-fei-hung"
    
    
        target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    
    >Once Upon A Time In China</a></em> 13 years later, which features the same main character, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wong_Fei-hung"
    
    
        target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    
    >Wong Fei Hung</a>. The structure really fits with the whole &ldquo;drunken fists&rdquo; fighting style: The slow, deep start tricks the enemy into thinking you can&rsquo;t react fast enough because of the alcohol, but then&ndash; <strong>BAM</strong>! You hit them in the face.</p>

<p>The rest of the music is fine, with an honorable mention to the 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY5M3NsZ_Uk"
    
    
        target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    
    >track</a> that plays in the comedy scene where Jackie is punished, which sounds fun and lighthearted. And speaking of comedy, this movie has plenty of it, and it&rsquo;s very good. The movie&rsquo;s tagline on TMDB is <em>&ldquo;The Original Kung Fu Comedy!&rdquo;</em>, and it certainly feels like it. You can&rsquo;t stop smiling when Chan plays with his instructor&rsquo;s hat, or when he stops fighting just to eat. When he cheats in his training with Beggar So, or even when his own dad punishes him for his recklessness, you can&rsquo;t help but to feel like a child laughing at such simple jokes; and when they&rsquo;re perfectly paired with the action, it&rsquo;s some of the best fun you can have while watching a movie. So much so that I think <strong>the comedy here is better than in Jackie Chan&rsquo;s later works</strong>. But there are some moments where that bar goes <em>low</em>. The scene where Chan farts in someone&rsquo;s face hits hard: You &ldquo;wake up&rdquo; from all the fun you were having and ask yourself, <em>&ldquo;who thought this was funny?&rdquo;</em>. Luckily, it only happens once or twice.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a quirky and fun movie. If you don&rsquo;t mind subpar acting or goofiness, and want to have some good laughs, I would recommend this movie. If you like other Chan&rsquo;s works (or just fighting movies in general), this is a must-watch, and a masterclass in action-comedy.</p>
