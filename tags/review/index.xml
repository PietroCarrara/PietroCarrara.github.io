However, the Japanese are aware of their plans, and send their agents to infiltrate and sabotage the mission.
This film has spies doing what they do best: handling information. The first scene has the protagonists split into 2 groups, with no radios or other ways to contact each other. In a following scene, when one of the groups learns that they&amp;rsquo;re being watched, they must pass this information to their teammates without busting their identity.</description></item></channel></rss>
