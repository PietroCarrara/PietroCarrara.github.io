It has almost all the elements that became synonymous with Chan&amp;rsquo;s later movies: Great fighting mixed with comedy and his high energy charisma. The only thing that&amp;rsquo;s missing is the crazy stunts, but the movie has enough kung-fu to make up for it.</description></item><item><title>Movie Review: Cliff Walkers (2021)</title><link>https://pietrocarrara.github.io/posts/2021-07-28-cliff-walkers-2021-review/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 13:52:46 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://pietrocarrara.github.io/posts/2021-07-28-cliff-walkers-2021-review/</guid><description>Cliff Walkers follows 4 Chinese spies trying to reach the Japanese-dominated city of Harbin, where they should await for further instructions. However, the Japanese are aware of their plans, and send their agents to infiltrate and sabotage the mission.
This film has spies doing what they do best: handling information. The first scene has the protagonists split into 2 groups, with no radios or other ways to contact each other.</description></item></channel></rss>
