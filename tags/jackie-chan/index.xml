It has almost all the elements that became synonymous with Chan&amp;rsquo;s later movies: Great fighting mixed with comedy and his high energy charisma. The only thing that&amp;rsquo;s missing is the crazy stunts, but the movie has enough kung-fu to make up for it.</description></item></channel></rss>
