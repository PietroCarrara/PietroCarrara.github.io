Translated as &amp;ldquo;Umineko When They Cry&amp;rdquo;, the story is about how, during the 2 days of the yearly Ushiromiya family conference, the people present are killed in apparently impossible murders, with the bodies of the victims found in rooms locked from the inside.</description></item><item><title>Movie Review: Drunken Master (1978)</title><link>https://pietrocarrara.github.io/en/posts/2021-08-07-drunken-master-1978-review/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Aug 2021 14:25:23 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://pietrocarrara.github.io/en/posts/2021-08-07-drunken-master-1978-review/</guid><description>Drunken Master is one of the movies that helped set-up Jackie Chan&amp;rsquo;s career as a martial artist, along with Snake in the Eagle&amp;rsquo;s Shadow and The Young Master. It has almost all the elements that became synonymous with Chan&amp;rsquo;s later movies: Great fighting mixed with comedy and his high energy charisma. The only thing that&amp;rsquo;s missing is the crazy stunts, but the movie has enough kung-fu to make up for it.</description></item><item><title>Movie Review: Cliff Walkers (2021)</title><link>https://pietrocarrara.github.io/en/posts/2021-07-28-cliff-walkers-2021-review/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 13:52:46 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://pietrocarrara.github.io/en/posts/2021-07-28-cliff-walkers-2021-review/</guid><description>Cliff Walkers follows 4 Chinese spies trying to reach the Japanese-dominated city of Harbin, where they should await for further instructions. However, the fascists are aware of their plans, and send their agents to infiltrate and sabotage the mission.
This film has spies doing what they do best: handling information. The first scene has the protagonists split into 2 groups, with no radios or other ways to contact each other. In a following scene, when one of the groups learns that they&amp;rsquo;re being watched, they must pass this information to their teammates without busting their identity.</description></item></channel></rss>
